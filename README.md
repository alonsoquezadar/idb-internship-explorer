# IDB Internship Explorer

A lightweight dashboard to browse and filter internship opportunities at the **Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)** Group.

## What it does

Aggregates student internship postings from [jobs.iadb.org](https://jobs.iadb.org) into a single, searchable interface — making it easier to find positions that match your profile without navigating multiple pages on the official portal.

## Features

- **Keyword search** across titles, descriptions, and requirements
- **Filter by area of specialization**: Public Policy, Economics & Business, Data & Tech, Law, Social Sciences, and more
- **Graduate / Master toggle** to narrow results by education level
- **At-a-glance cards** showing education requirements, technical skills, location, and closing dates
- **Direct links** to each posting on the official IDB careers site
- Mobile-friendly with sticky filters

## Tech

Single HTML file — no frameworks, no build step. Uses Bootstrap 5 for layout, Google Fonts (DM Sans + Instrument Serif), and vanilla JavaScript for filtering.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any browser, or deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial tool for personal use. Vacancy data is sourced from the IDB's public job portal and may not reflect real-time availability. Always verify details on [jobs.iadb.org](https://jobs.iadb.org) before applying.
